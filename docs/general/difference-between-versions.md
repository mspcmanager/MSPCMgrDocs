# Differences between versions

Two branches are currently available for Microsoft PC Manager: **China** and **Global**. 
- The ***China*** branch has a faster release cycle and includes more localized features, but may not be suitable for privacy laws in other countries / regions (e.g.: General Data Protection Regulation, [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) in the European Union). 
- The ***Global*** branch has better compliance with local laws, but at the cost of longer release cycles (due to strict compliance) and fewer new features.

But rest assured, both versions are *SAFE* and comply with the promises in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement).
